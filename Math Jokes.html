</h3></div>
<div class="working">
A stats professor plans to travel to a conference by plane. When he passes the security check, they discover a bomb in his carry-on-baggage. Of course, he is hauled off immediately for interrogation. <br>
"I don't understand it!" the interrogating officer exclaims. "You're an accomplished professional, a caring family man, a pillar of your parish - and now you want to destroy that all by blowing up an airplane!" <br>
"Sorry", the professor interrupts him. "I had never intended to blow up the plane." <br>
"So, for what reason else did you try to bring a bomb on board?!" <br>
"Let me explain. Statistics shows that the probability of a bomb being on an airplane is 1/1000. That's quite high if you think about it - so high that I wouldn't have any peace of mind on a flight." <br>
"And what does this have to do with you bringing a bomb on board of a plane?" <br>
"You see, since the probability of one bomb being on my plane is 1/1000, the chance that there are two bombs is 1/1000000. If I already bring one, the chance of another bomb being around is actually 1/1000000, and I am much safer..."

"x-cubed"<br>
"ex-cooooobed"<br>
"divided by 3"<br>
"deevided by tree"<br>
So the other professor comes back from the bathroom and the optimistic professor says "Hey your statement earlier really upset me. Look I bet I can prove that an ordinary working girl knows high level math" <br>
The other professor says "Alright prove it to me"<br>
The first professor calls over the blonde bartender and says "Alright what is the integral of x-squared?"<br>
And the bartender answers "x-cubed divided by 3!" as she walks away the other professor is all amazed. <br>
Suddenly the bartender turns around and yells "PLUS THE CONSTANT OF INTEGRATION!"

<div class= "namingishard"><h3>Fire in the room 
</h3></div>
<div class="working">
A physicist and engineer and a mathematician were sleeping in a hotel room when a fire broke out in one corner of the room. Only the engineer woke up he saw the fire, grabbed a bucket of water and threw it on the fire and the fire went out, then he filled up the bucket again and threw that bucketfull on the ashes as a safety factor, and he went back to sleep. A little later, another fire broke out in a different corner of the room and only the physicist woke up. He went over measured the intensity of the fire, saw what material was burning and went over and carefully measured out exactly 2/3 of a bucket of water and poured it on, putting out the fire perfectly; the physicist went back to sleep. A little later another fire broke out in a different corner of the room. Only the mathematician woke up. He went over looked at the fire, he saw that there was a bucket and he noticed that it had no holes in it; he turned on the faucet and saw that there was water available. He, thus, concluded that there was a solution to the fire problem and he went back to sleep.

<div class= "namingishard"><h3>Fire in the room #2
</h3></div>
<div class="working">
Three professors (a physicist, a chemist, and a statistician) are called in to see their dean.  Just as they arrive the dean is called out of his office, leaving the three professors there.  The professors see with alarm that there is a fire in the wastebasket. The physicist says, "I know what to do! We must cool down the materials until their temperature is lower than the ignition temperature and then the fire will go out." The chemist says, "No! No! I know what to do! We must cut off the supply of oxygen so that the fire will go out due to lack of one of the reactants." While the physicist and chemist debate what course to take, they both are alarmed to see the statistician running around the room starting other fires.  They both scream, "What are you doing?" To which the statistician replies, "Trying to get an adequate sample size."
