<div class="working">
When most people hear the name "Simmons College" they usually think of a small 
women's liberal arts college located in the heart of Boston.  In terms of programs at the school, 
most people only know about the undergraduate nursing program or the graduate library sciences program.  
When most people think about those who choose to major in math they picture chalkboards in dusty classrooms, 
old men who lecture in a dull monotone, and complicated formulas that make no sense.  So when someone 
who attends Simmons College mentions that they're majoring in math, people around them may 
express surprise that they're going to Simmons and studying <i>math</i>, that they're studying 
math and going to <i>Simmons</i>, or both.  At first glance, the vibrant liberal arts student 
can seem so vastly different from the smart and serious math student that it can be hard to 
understand how they can be the same person.

<div class= "namingishard"><h3>Diverse Program Selection</h3></div>
<div class="working">
Simmons has a wide variety of programs, including many that are not available at schools 
with better known math programs.  Want to double major in math and women's studies, math and 
arts management, or math and social work?  You'd be out of luck if you were studying at MIT 
instead of Simmons.

<div class= "namingishard"><h3>Diverse individuals</h3></div>
<div class="working">
As a math major at Simmons, the vast majority of people you interact with on campus will be 
neither math students nor math professors.  This means you will be friends with a much wider 
range of individuals than if you went to a school with a large math department.
